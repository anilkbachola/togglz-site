  Feature Groups <span class="label label-important">since 1.1.0</span>
  
%p
  If you are using Togglz regularly, you will soon end up with a large number of feature toggles.
  To make sure you don't get lost in all the different feature flags, Togglz allows to define group for features.
  
  Currently feature groups are just used for a visual grouping in the admin console. So if you are not using the admin console, there is very little use for feature groups.
%p
  There are different ways of using feature groups you can think of:

%ul
  %li
    Grouping by some category (e.g. Performance)  
  %li
    Grouping by application version number (e.g. Release 2.0)
  %li
    Separation of older feature flags that weren't removed 

%p
  To define a feature group, you have to create a custom annotation. See the following example:
  
%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    @FeatureGroup
    @Label("Performance Improvements")
    @Target(ElementType.FIELD)
    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
    public @interface Performance {
      // no content
    }

%p
  The annotation itself has to be annotated with <code>@FeatureGroup</code> to tell Togglz that the annotation
  has to be handled as a feature group. The <code>@Label</code> annotation is optional and allows to define a custom
  name for the group. If it is omitted, the name of the annotation will be used instead. The other two annotations
  tell the compiler that the annotation is only allowed on fields and that it should be compiled into the resulting
  class files.

%p
  To add features to the group, just add the new annotation to the feature enum like this: 

%pre(class="prettyprint lang-java")
  :escaped
    public enum MyFeatures implements Feature {
    
        @Label("Enable database caching")
        @Performance
        DATABASE_CACHING,
        
        @Label("Some other one")
        OTHER_FEATURE;

        /* ... */        
        
    }

%p
  Feature groups will automatically show up as a separate tab in the <a href="admin-console.html">Togglz Admin Console</a>.
